#Phaser Game Template
I have been learning how to create games with Phaser. I find myself creating lots of files over and over again whenever a new idea comes up. So, here is a template of how I think games can start with.

-Preload assets (behind the scenes)
-Opening Splash Screen
-A menu or Press Start screen
-Your game's first level

You can add game over, help etc.
